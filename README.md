# solon_discord
This project was a way for me to learn how to use libraries such as Selenium and discord.py. I originally tried this with using a library called 'BeautifulSoup'
but quickly ran into errors. Overall, I think this project is a great way to learn web scraping in a non-harmful and legal way, there are many ways things can go wrong
on the legal side if your not careful, such as ddos hacking. Also, this provides a technical use for me and my fellow classmates because it allows us to access
publicly displayed information even through Discord, which was an overall plus.
